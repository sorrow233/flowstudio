1. Analyze the current codebase or the specific feature recently implemented.
2. Look for logical errors, potential null pointer exceptions, and performance bottlenecks.
3. Check for code duplication and "God files" that need splitting.
4. Verify user experience issues (e.g., UI responsiveness, feedback).
5. Report findings in a structured list.
6. Propose solutions for each identified issue.
